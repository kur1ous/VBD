            <h2>My Dearest, My Baby, My Love, My Veronica.</h2>
            <p>
              I still remember our first kiss as if it were yesterday.
              I was looking into your eyes, you were looking into mine.
              You were laying down on my lap, and it felt like I held the whole world in my hands.
              My legs were generating earthquakes, my heart was pounding harder than any rhythm I'd ever known.
              Our eyes locked into one another, every thought rushing right out of my mind, completely focused on you.
              I came closer, you came closer, slowly, our lips met one another, and for the first time I felt truly at home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every moment I spend with you is my favourite. The loud laughs we share,
              the quiet conversations we have, it reminds me just how much I love you.
            </p>
            <p class="signoff">
              With all my love, now and forever,
              <span id="fromNameCard">Me</span>
